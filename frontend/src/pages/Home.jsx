      <h1>Understanding Diabetes</h1>
      <p>
        <b>Type 2 Diabetes</b> is a chronic condition that affects how your body processes blood sugar (glucose). It occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or when the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin to maintain normal glucose levels. Unlike Type 1 Diabetes, which is primarily genetic and autoimmune, Type 2 Diabetes is often linked to lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity, and weight management.
        This condition is one of the most common health challenges worldwide, impacting millions of people. If left unmanaged, it can lead to serious complications such as heart disease, nerve damage, kidney problems, and vision loss. However, with the right lifestyle changes, medication, and monitoring, Type 2 Diabetes can be effectively controlled, allowing individuals to lead a healthy and active life.

      <h2>Epidemiology & Statistics</h2>
      <p>According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), over 500 million people worldwide live with diabetes, and the number is expected to rise significantly in the coming decades.</p>
      <p>India is often referred to as the "Diabetes Capital of the World", with an alarming increase in Type 2 Diabetes cases over the past few decades. As of 2023, India had over 101 million people living with diabetes, making it one of the most affected countries globally. The rapid urbanization, sedentary lifestyle, high consumption of processed foods, and genetic predisposition have contributed significantly to this rise.</p>
      
      <p><b>Key statistics about Type 2 Diabetes in India:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Approximately 11.4% of adults in India have diabetes.</li>
        <li>Urban areas show a higher prevalence (~15-20%) compared to rural regions (~5-7%) due to lifestyle differences.</li>
        <li>While it was traditionally seen in older adults, cases among younger individuals (20s and 30s) have increased significantly due to unhealthy eating habits and lack of physical activity.</li>
        <li>Southern and Western states have reported higher prevalence rates compared to Northern and Eastern states.</li>
      </ul>
